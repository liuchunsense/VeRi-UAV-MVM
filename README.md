## What is VeRi-UAV-MVM?

Because there is rare dataset with mask labels under drone capture view, we label 3,000 vehicles with different perspective masks on the VeRi-UAV dataset and VeRi-776 dataset, to form the VeRi-UAV-MVM dataset for perspective mask segmentation. The VeRi-UAV dataset and the VeRi-776 dataset are from original datasets. We just provide their mask labels.

We label 3,000 vehicles in VeRi-UAV dataset with four different parts: front, rear, side and top surface, to form the VeRi-UAV-MVM dataset for perspective mask segmentation.
